## 👀 What's This?

Pongo is an OSle-based tiny operating system with 16-bit support.

It's written in x86 assembly and, despite its tiny size (only 510 bytes), it 
packs essential features like:

- **Shell**: Run commands and builtins.
- **File System**: Read, write, and find files on the system.
- **Process Management**: Cooperatively spawn child processes.
- **Userland Software**: Comes with [pre-built software](./bin/) and an 
[SDK](./sdk/) to write your own.

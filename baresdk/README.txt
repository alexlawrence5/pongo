This is an custom-SDK called BareSDK which allows you to build, emulate the vmpongz image.

If you are going to build an Pongo executable file, DO NOT USE THIS SDK! Because, this SDK isn't created for executable-building purposes and it doesn't include an executable-builder.
It is only created for compiling and emulating purposes.

However, if you still want to use this SDK to build executable binaries, you need to create your own executable-builder on this SDK.
